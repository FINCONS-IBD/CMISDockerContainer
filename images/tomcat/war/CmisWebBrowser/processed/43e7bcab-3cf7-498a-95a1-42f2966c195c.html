  <href id="poli_3609_3613">
    pol
  </href>i- cies based on system principals or resource levels are insufficient and inflexible. Instead, attributes enable domain and application specific control mechanisms. Policies and their enforcement can be adapted to specific needs by considering individually defined and trusted attributes. As a consequence, the IDM presented in this contribution addresses the spe- cific needs and
  <href id="security_3995_4003">

    technologie
  </href>s feasible for
  <href id="IoT_4042_4045">
    Io
  </href>T systems. Thus, a reliable attribute-based principal management that enforces the correct and authorized declaration and definition of attributes becomes inevitable. 2.2 Attribute Assurance Once users can define their own identity schemes in the platform, they start to resemble small identity silos with their own self-defined attributes. As a result, enabling users to interact and exchange identity
  <href id="information_4449_4460">
    informatio
  </href>n becomes critical. To exemplify the challenges to be tackled, we consider the following scenario. Two companies provide sensor data through an
  <href id="IoT_4604_4607">
    Io
  </href>T platform: SensIoT, and fakeIoT. Further, assume each company creates an attribute called produced by containing the name of the company. Most likely, sensor containing the attribute produced by with value SensIoT will be used more. However, unless there is a mechanism enforcing that only devices belonging to SensIoT can assign the value SensIoT to the attribute produced by, fakeIoT could start faking attribute values to fool customers. Even though this example could be solved by including a simple customized
  <href id="verification_5122_5134">
    verificatio
  </href>n, the question is, how to enable companies, or groups of users, to define attributes which require approval before those attributes are considered reliable. We call this process attribute assurance, given its affinity to a more process driven aspect of
  <href id="Federated_Identity_5387_5405">
    Federated Identit
  </href>y Management (FIDM), called identity assurance [6, 7]. IDM in Platforms offering IoTaaS 3 2.3 Sharing Attributes with Other Users Users should be able to decide whether they consider attribute values approved by other users, or groups of users, to be sufficiently reliable for supporting
  <href id="pol_5698_5701">
    po
  </href>l- icy decisions. This is a parallel challenge to managing trust in FIDM [6] with an additional pitfall: the inclusion of users preferences should not increase the complexity of policy decisions. We discuss two possibilities to manage trusted attributes and analyse their
  <href id="computational_complexity_5972_5996">
    computational complexit
  </href>y. For this purpose, let n be the number of attribute values for a device, service, or user that require ap-
  <href id="proval_6104_6110">
    prova
  </href>l according to a policy1 and let the cost of verifying the approval status for a given attribute be in O(1). The first possibility is to use a global and centralized repository of at- tribute values and to authorize selected users to globally approve attributes. In this case policy
  <href id="evaluation_6393_6403">
    evaluatio
  </href>n could be in
  <href id="O(n)_6416_6420">
    O(n
  </href>). Only the
  <href id="verification_6431_6443">
    verificatio
  </href>n of an ap-
  <href id="proval_6454_6460">
    prova
  </href>l flag would be required for each attribute value. Policy evaluation becomes trivial as an approved attribute is automatically trusted system-wide. However, authorized users wont be elected freely, declining the possibility to benefit from approval mechanisms to most of the users in the
  <href id="IoT_6747_6750">
    Io
  </href>T platform; also, the attribute approvals become unmanageable for a limited number of authorized users. A completely opposite approach is to allow users to set and approve attribute values. In such an ad-hoc sharing
  <href id="scheme_6966_6972">
    schem
  </href>e for attributes the most important question is whether an attribute value has been approved by a trusted user. This notion can be implemented by adding credibility to attributes [8]. Users specify a list of trusted users for each attribute used in a policy. Let k be the number of users in the system. K is both, the upper bound of attribute approvals for a given attribute value, as well as the upper bound of trusted users chosen for each one of the n attributes. In this case, the
  <href id="computational_complexity_7456_7480">
    computational complexit
  </href>y of the policy evaluation is in O(n ?? k2). For each approval, it must be verified whether a trusted user approved the value. Although flexible, this approach induces hig

  </href>er, before memberships are considered effective by the IDM system, it has to be approved by two parties: the administrator of g, and u. In this way users cannot be misplaced in a group, and groups only contain approved users. Due to this property, groups are the cornerstone for attribute assurance and for the sharing of attribute values among users (Section 3.3 and 3.4). 3.2 System Structure The IDM system contains eight modules shown in Figure 1.

Attribute definition purposes, attribute values are only valid after they have been approved by ad- ministrators of the group where the attribute definition is registered in. Figure 2 shows two groups (SensIoT and FakeIoT) that have an attribute called Made in, and also two devices with approved attribute values for the Made in at- tribute definitions in each group. Also, both devices have values pointing to the same attribute definition (approved by the same authority) for the Location attribute, previously defined inside the weather group. This implies an approval from an administrator of Weather group for Himalayas (both devices). 3.4 Sharing Attributes with Other Users Given the properties described in the previous section, groups are employed as a mechanism to let users express which users (in a group) are considered trusted. Here is the advantage in terms of policy evaluation: when users refer to the attribute definition directly in their policies (e.g. Made in attribute definition inside SensIoT), the complexity2 of the policy evaluatio

  </href>ez et al. attributes may change over time and confuse users but they are not critical. However, safety relevant services need to make sure only sensors with assured attributes, such as the height or location, are used. This particularly holds for services casting warnings or taking actions. For this purpose, service providers can define policies described by simple predicates validating attribute and check
